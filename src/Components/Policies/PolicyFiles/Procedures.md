# Policy for Snail Mail

<br/>
June 1, 2007
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Residents,
<br/>
<br/>
In the recent past, there have been complaints from some residents of missing couriers. To avoid this type of unwanted incidents, we are making the following change in the procedure of delivering couriers. This procedure will be in place from June 4, 2007 until further notice.
<br />
All couriers of the residents will be delivered directly to the hostel supervisor by the courier agents from 9:00hrs to 13:00hrs and from 14:00hrs to 18:00hrs on all working days.
<br />
As and when the courier comes, the hostel supervisor will make an entry in an excel sheet with the following details: courier company, receipient's name and receipient's room number.
<br />
The hostel supervisor will upload the information from the excel sheet around 17:00hrs everyday at the hostel website and the residents should collect their mails from the next day onwards. The time to collect your mails and policy for trashing of old mails will be as per the previous policy.
<br />
When a student comes to collect the courier, he will be asked to enter the necessary details in a register which will be kept in the hostel supervisor's office.
<br />
Couriers of HOR-Women residents will be forwarded by the supervisor around 17:00hrs on all working days to the lady guard of HOR-Women.
<br />
During 18:00hrs to 9:00hrs (evening to next day morning on working days), weekends and holidays, the couriers will not be collected and the courier agents' staff will be asked to come on a working day.
<br />
The residents are responsible to check the hostel website regularly for their couriers and should collect it within 10 days from the date of courier posted.
<br />
Your suggestions to improve this procedure are most welcome.

Warden
